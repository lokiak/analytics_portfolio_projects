    "Our target audience of this analysis of **\"Iowa Quarterly Retail Sales Tax Data by 12 Business Groups\"** will be valuable to various retails as a means of gauging, to some degree, consumer tax sensitivities on a county level in Iowa and with respect to business groups. This analysis could prove insightful for both state/county/municipal bodies gauging the impact of their consumption taxes and to draw relationships between number of returns & taxable sales to other population or census-related data on a county level as well, as a means of gauging relationships (depending on other parameters as well) between, for example, household income and taxable sales. Retailers or Businesses could also use this data for the same purposes, as well as incorporating analysis of consumption taxes as part of a larger aggregate demand effects (increase in consumption taxes affecting consumer disposable income, affecting consumer spending, etc.).  \n",

We have already identified columns 5 through 8 that contain 'S' strings in lieu of earlier analysis. Interestingly enough, column 4 or \"Business Group\" contains objects but our previous sample revealed strings and given the name of the column, I believe it's appropriate to assume that Business Group should exclusively contain string datatypes. The same circumstances apply to \"County\".\n",

    "## **Review of Data Outliers Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It appears that June 2003 (with one March 2019 making an appearance in the 3/4 case) is a special year. Further data exploration, possibly joining other datasets or researching for additional context, may help to explain why June 2003 appears to be an anomalous quarter ending value. There is no direct relationship between the counties to indicate anything (as each row is distinct based on county), but we can see that there are a low number of returns for the 3/4 case--possibly, these values were overlooked in substituting their numeric values for 'S' values. This may also be reinforced by the 0.00% value under Percent of Tax (March 2019) whereas the other values within the row are S values--another missed substitution.\n",
    "* Even more interesting is that there are significant values for taxable sales for the 1/4 case and yet the Number of Returns are treated as insignificant--again, occurring within the June 2003 quarter ending. This could also indicate some type of reporting error, somewhere along the data pipeline between the commercial enterprise and the county database--maybe the data isn't being properly ingested? Perhaps some constraints were applied during ingestion that should be relaxed?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to remove these rows from analysis, as I believe the data should be considered garbage given the errors--since the Number of Returns is insignificant, I don't believe removing the rows will have a statistically significant impact on downstream analysis."

    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 202324.000000 as a max for \"Number of Returns\" is an exceptionally high value. Same goes 1.318421e+10 in \"Taxable Sales\" and 7.889983e+08 in \"Computed Tax\". These outliers likely will significantly skew our analysis, evidenced by our standard deviations.\n",
    "* Now that we have datetime and we know that the Quarter Ending operates based on fiscal year, it's time to update the quarter ending dates to the actual dates - we discover in the cell above that between the years 2000 and 2024, there is a pattern in fiscal quarter ending months which follows the quarterly basis of the typical fiscal year (Gregorian calendar). In this case, the fiscal quarters end on 03-31, 06-30, 09-40, and 12-31, which is consistent with the months listed in the dataframe. We can safely update these dates with the correct datetimes for proper analysis going forward.\n",

    "Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",

    "### A few things to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can observe serious, high consistency in taxable sales between 2000 and 2006 -- with one outlier value for 2004 that makes me scratch my head as to what occurred during 2004 (we're not quite at the height of the housing bubble). Unsurprisingly, however, we do see a significant dip in taxable sales starting in 2007 for home furnishings, which marks the beginning of the housing crisis in America. The median value drops at a significant rate between 2005 and 2006, and while not evident of a housing bubble, it does inspire one to wonder about correlations between home furnishing sales and other factors with mortgage-backed securities at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We also see an incredible spike during 2020, when the FRED rate was at a historic low (mortage rates ended up dropping below 3%!!) during the onset of COVID--2 compounding factors that drove individuals to purchase homes AND to buy more home furnishings because they weren't going out! It would be interesting to relate this data to home sales data in Jasper County during this year (and during the 2007-2008 market crash).\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2021 figures look too crunchy - the data here may be skewed or non-representational of that year - potential for further exploration of 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2000-2001 also was the Dot Com bubble, so this may also reflect in Home Furnishings as well similar to the housing crisis of 2007-2008."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis of the Iowa Retail Sales Tax dataset, we revealed several insights on taxable sales within Jasper County's home furnishings sector. From 2000 to 2006, taxable sales exhibited remarkable consistency, indicating a stable market environment. As anticipated, a significant dip in taxable sales emerged starting in 2007, aligning with the onset of the housing crisis in America. This decline was particularly pronounced between 2005 and 2006, where the median taxable sales dropped sharply. While this downturn doesn't directly signify a housing bubble, it does suggest potential correlations between home furnishing sales and broader economic factors, such as the fluctuations in mortgage-backed securities during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The year 2020 presented a stark contrast, marked by an incredible spike in taxable sales. This surge coincided with historically low mortgage rates—around 3% or less—and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding factors likely drove individuals to purchase homes and invest more in home furnishings as they adapted to lockdowns and remote living conditions. It would be intriguing to correlate this data with home sales figures in Jasper County during 2020 and compare it to the trends observed during the 2007-2008 market crash to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior during economic upheavals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on Jasper County, my analysis identified the top five business groups contributing to taxable sales across all fiscal years:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utilities and Transportation** (over 2 million dollars)  \n",
    "2. **Service** (slightly above 1 million dollars)  \n",
    "3. **General Merchandise** (approximately 750K dollars)  \n",
    "4. **Food Dealers** (nearly 750K dollars)  \n",
    "5. **Eating and Drinking** (around 600K dollars)  \n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution reflects a balanced mix of residential and commercial enterprises that support community growth and retention. These business groups are essential for sustaining residential areas, as they cater to everyday needs and foster economic stability within the county. It comes as no surprise that Jasper County sits on the periphery of Des Moines, which is the capital and most populous city of Iowa by far throughout the 21st century. \n",
    "\n",
    "- During our data quality and transformation review, I identified several outliers:\n",
    "  - Maximum of 202,324 in \"Number of Returns\"\n",
    "  - 13,184,210,000 dollars in \"Taxable Sales\"\n",
    "  - 788,998,300 dollars in \"Computed Tax\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "These extreme values significantly skewed our dataset, as evidenced by the high standard deviations across respective columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recognizing the importance of accurate data, I implemented the following updates:\n",
    "  - Updated the \"Quarter Ending\" dates to reflect the actual end-of-quarter dates: 03-31, 06-30, 09-30, and 12-31, ensuring consistency for future time series analyses.\n",
    "  - Addressed suppressed data represented by 'S' values by:\n",
    "    - Converting them to NaN\n",
    "    - Dropping approximately 12,437 out of 126,146 rows to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploration of data anomalies revealed specific quarters, such as for June 2003 and March 2019, with irregularities like suppressed returns and inconsistent taxable sales figures. These anomalies suggest potential data entry errors or issues in the data ingestion process. Given the questionable accuracy of these entries, I decided to exclude these rows from further analysis to preserve the dataset's reliability without significantly impacting downstream analyses.\n",
